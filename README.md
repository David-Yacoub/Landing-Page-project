# Landing Page Project

This project aims to give a real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality serves two purposes: to prepare appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.
